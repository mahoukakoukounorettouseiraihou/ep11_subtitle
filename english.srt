FEBRUARY 20, 2096

2
00:00:36,370 --> 00:00:39,950
If you ever want to quit being a soldier,

3
00:00:39,950 --> 00:00:41,830
I think I can help.

4
00:00:46,290 --> 00:00:49,290
Why did Tatsuya say such a thing?

5
00:01:08,790 --> 00:01:12,620
Sure, it pained me
to point a gun at my own.

6
00:01:14,950 --> 00:01:22,490
But rather than let them live as demons,
I wanted their souls to rest in peace.

7
00:01:24,540 --> 00:01:28,990
This was a job that only I could do as Sirius,

8
00:01:28,990 --> 00:01:32,540
the most powerful magician.

9
00:01:35,240 --> 00:01:36,950
Only me?

10
00:01:44,040 --> 00:01:45,910
I see.

11
00:01:45,910 --> 00:01:50,200
That was why I was lost and impatient.

12
00:01:58,330 --> 00:02:02,660
I can be something other than Sirius.

13
00:03:34,200 --> 00:03:38,440
MARCH 15, 2096

14
00:03:38,790 --> 00:03:43,200
"NATIONAL MAGIC UNIVERSITY
AFFILIATED FIRST HIGH SCHOOL"
"29th GRADUATION CEREMONY"

15
00:04:31,330 --> 00:04:34,080
The sealed parasites are gone?

16
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:36,120
I'm sorry, Tatsuya.

17
00:04:36,120 --> 00:04:39,870
I didn't mean to take my eyes off them.

18
00:04:39,870 --> 00:04:42,700
Tatsuya, I'm really sorry.

19
00:04:42,700 --> 00:04:46,450
Tatsuya, please don't blame
Shibata or Mitsui.

20
00:04:46,450 --> 00:04:51,490
Even I didn't notice
the sealed vessels being taken away.

21
00:04:51,490 --> 00:04:52,890
They were my seals, too.

22
00:04:52,890 --> 00:04:54,580
All three of you...

23
00:04:54,580 --> 00:04:56,910
Stop blaming yourselves.

24
00:04:56,910 --> 00:04:59,040
I don't mind at all.

25
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:00,870
Tatsuya...

26
00:05:00,870 --> 00:05:05,330
It only means whoever did it
is one step better than us.

27
00:05:05,330 --> 00:05:10,040
I actually hadn't thought much about
what to do with them after we caught them,

28
00:05:10,040 --> 00:05:12,410
and it's not worth
obsessing over it anyway.

29
00:05:12,410 --> 00:05:16,870
That's right. It's not because
you were careless, Miki.

30
00:05:16,870 --> 00:05:20,290
You're so cruel, you know.

31
00:05:31,620 --> 00:05:34,990
Still, though...
Was this what they were after all along?

32
00:05:38,330 --> 00:05:40,700
Brother, thank you for waiting.

33
00:05:40,700 --> 00:05:42,830
The party's all finished.

34
00:05:42,830 --> 00:05:44,290
I hope you enjoyed it.

35
00:05:49,410 --> 00:05:51,990
What were you writing, Tatsuya?

36
00:05:51,990 --> 00:05:58,120
Just a few notes about system-level assistance
that could lengthen spell duration.

37
00:05:59,040 --> 00:06:05,200
I don't think that's the sort of topic
you can just brush off like that.

38
00:06:05,200 --> 00:06:08,700
Anyway, what are you all here for?

39
00:06:08,700 --> 00:06:15,120
I'm sure both of you have gotten
more than a few after-party invitations.

40
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:19,410
We wanted to bid you farewell.

41
00:06:20,990 --> 00:06:22,370
That's very kind of you.

42
00:06:22,370 --> 00:06:24,490
You didn't have to come all the way here.

43
00:06:24,490 --> 00:06:27,990
I was planning to come by
and say goodbye to you all.

44
00:06:27,990 --> 00:06:29,910
Oh, you did?

45
00:06:29,910 --> 00:06:34,160
We thought you pretended
not to notice and went home

46
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:37,160
because you were cooped up here
during the party.

47
00:06:37,160 --> 00:06:39,660
I can't exactly turn up
at a graduation party

48
00:06:39,660 --> 00:06:42,330
when I'm not even on the Student Council.

49
00:06:42,330 --> 00:06:44,700
Especially not the Course 1 party.

50
00:06:44,700 --> 00:06:46,330
Why not?

51
00:06:46,330 --> 00:06:48,330
Why did they make me help with the party

52
00:06:48,330 --> 00:06:50,910
when I'm not even an
official Student Council member...

53
00:06:50,910 --> 00:06:54,410
and someone on the Disciplinary Committee
doesn't have to do anything?

54
00:06:55,330 --> 00:06:58,080
Disciplinary Committee members
aren't on the Student Council.

55
00:06:58,080 --> 00:07:02,200
And you're technically still on the Student Council
even though it's temporary, aren't you?

56
00:07:03,240 --> 00:07:05,410
You'll need more than that to convince me!

57
00:07:05,410 --> 00:07:06,790
Wait, Lina.

58
00:07:06,790 --> 00:07:09,450
Don't be rude to my brother.

59
00:07:09,450 --> 00:07:12,040
We decided before we started
setting up for the graduation party

60
00:07:12,040 --> 00:07:14,620
that you were a temporary
Student Council member

61
00:07:14,620 --> 00:07:19,120
and that my brother was
a Disciplinary Committee member.

62
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:22,370
Besides, you were so keen
on the idea before.

63
00:07:23,580 --> 00:07:25,290
Miyuki, what do you mean?

64
00:07:25,290 --> 00:07:26,330
Oh, well...

65
00:07:26,330 --> 00:07:28,120
It's nothing, Tatsuya!

66
00:07:28,120 --> 00:07:30,290
Since Lina is a temporary officer,

67
00:07:30,290 --> 00:07:34,620
we would've felt bad putting her on a task
that demanded very much work.

68
00:07:34,620 --> 00:07:42,490
Miyuki!

69
00:07:34,620 --> 00:07:38,200
Instead, we put her in charge
of the day's entertainment, but...

70
00:07:38,200 --> 00:07:42,490
...when I said "entertainment,"
I didn't mean she had to do something.

71
00:07:42,490 --> 00:07:47,910
I meant just rounding up students
and graduates who wanted to. But...

72
00:07:45,790 --> 00:07:47,910
Miyuki, don't say it!

73
00:07:47,910 --> 00:07:50,200
Lina seems to have misunderstood, and...

74
00:07:50,200 --> 00:07:52,700
Miyuki, please! Don't tell him!

75
00:07:52,700 --> 00:07:53,660
And?

76
00:07:53,660 --> 00:07:56,040
Yes, and...

77
00:07:56,040 --> 00:07:59,330
she got up onstage in front of the band.

78
00:08:00,490 --> 00:08:04,740
Then, she sung about ten songs in a row.
Everyone was very excited.

79
00:08:04,740 --> 00:08:07,580
Yeah, that was a pretty good
live performance.

80
00:08:07,580 --> 00:08:09,580
Better than some professional ones.

81
00:08:09,580 --> 00:08:13,330
It's true. You're very good
at singing, Shields.

82
00:08:13,330 --> 00:08:15,290
You have a wonderful voice.

83
00:08:17,240 --> 00:08:18,700
I see.

84
00:08:18,700 --> 00:08:21,580
You made a good memory today, Lina.

85
00:08:25,080 --> 00:08:26,830
Buzz off!

86
00:08:28,830 --> 00:08:31,740
MARCH 26, 2096 - TOKYO BAY MARITIME INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT

87
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:46,830
Shizuku should be here soon.

88
00:08:46,830 --> 00:08:48,200
Yep!

89
00:08:54,120 --> 00:08:56,240
Welcome home, Shizuku!

90
00:08:56,240 --> 00:08:57,700
Welcome home!

91
00:08:59,410 --> 00:09:02,080
I'm home, Honoka.

92
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:05,120
Welcome back, Shizuku.
I'm happy you had a safe flight.

93
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:07,290
Yep.

94
00:09:07,290 --> 00:09:10,240
Shizuku, you seem kind of different.

95
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:13,120
Yeah, more mature-like.

96
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:16,370
Have you had any experiences
you weren't supposed to over there?

97
00:09:16,370 --> 00:09:18,080
Erika!

98
00:09:19,160 --> 00:09:20,910
Tatsuya...

99
00:09:20,910 --> 00:09:23,700
There's a lot
I want to talk to you about.

100
00:09:23,700 --> 00:09:27,870
A lot of messages from Ray, too.
Wanna hear it now?

101
00:09:27,870 --> 00:09:30,450
Sure. Let me hear it.

102
00:09:34,700 --> 00:09:36,410
Thank you for waiting, everyone.

103
00:09:36,410 --> 00:09:36,970
All aboard.

104
00:09:36,970 --> 00:09:38,410
Okay.

105
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:43,700
Sorry, Shizuku. Be right back.

106
00:09:47,290 --> 00:09:49,740
Honoka, no getting in the way.

107
00:09:49,740 --> 00:09:52,200
They need to say goodbye to a rival.

108
00:09:58,700 --> 00:10:00,040
Lina!

109
00:10:02,660 --> 00:10:05,160
Tatsuya, Miyuki...

110
00:10:05,160 --> 00:10:07,580
Did you come to see me off?

111
00:10:07,580 --> 00:10:11,120
Something like that. Though actually,
running into you was a coincidence.

112
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:14,870
Wait. Didn't I tell you
what day I was leaving?

113
00:10:14,870 --> 00:10:16,870
I don't think so.

114
00:10:16,870 --> 00:10:17,830
By the way...

115
00:10:17,800 --> 00:10:20,890
"ASAKUSA"

116
00:10:22,740 --> 00:10:25,240
"FESTIVAL TAG"
"MT. FUJI"

117
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:28,490
You're sure taking home a lot.

118
00:10:28,490 --> 00:10:30,450
You must've gone on a shopping spree.

119
00:10:30,450 --> 00:10:32,240
Isn't it neat?

120
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:36,290
"BRAVO"

121
00:10:33,540 --> 00:10:36,290
Japanese culture is so cool!

122
00:10:36,290 --> 00:10:41,580
I've fallen in love with Japan
while studying here!

123
00:10:41,580 --> 00:10:44,240
Thanks for everything, you two.

124
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:47,410
Don't you mean "sorry for the trouble"?

125
00:10:47,410 --> 00:10:50,410
You're the ones who caused trouble for me.

126
00:10:50,410 --> 00:10:53,950
You really don't have any mercy,
even at the end, Tatsuya.

127
00:10:53,950 --> 00:10:57,620
I expect holding back
wouldn't make you any happier.

128
00:10:57,620 --> 00:11:00,740
And this isn't the end, right?

129
00:11:00,740 --> 00:11:02,620
Who knows?

130
00:11:02,620 --> 00:11:07,160
I'm pretty sure I wouldn't just leave
my home country on a dime.

131
00:11:07,160 --> 00:11:10,870
But no, this isn't the end.

132
00:11:10,870 --> 00:11:12,700
Miyuki?

133
00:11:12,700 --> 00:11:17,660
So, I'm not going to say goodbye, Lina.

134
00:11:17,660 --> 00:11:21,950
You know that sounds
kind of like a confession, right?

135
00:11:21,950 --> 00:11:25,290
Yes, maybe it's a kind of confession.

136
00:11:25,290 --> 00:11:29,830
You are my rival, Lina.

137
00:11:29,830 --> 00:11:36,160
I'm sure you'll take the help
my brother offered you.

138
00:11:36,160 --> 00:11:39,830
I know you'll join him.

139
00:11:39,830 --> 00:11:43,450
That will be when our
real competition begins.

140
00:11:45,450 --> 00:11:48,580
That's why I won't say goodbye.

141
00:11:48,580 --> 00:11:51,160
We'll see you again, Lina.

142
00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:58,200
I don't really understand
what you're talking about, but...

143
00:11:58,200 --> 00:12:04,120
I have a feeling
that you're going to be right.

144
00:12:04,120 --> 00:12:07,450
In that case, Miyuki, until we meet again...

145
00:12:09,330 --> 00:12:12,370
Tatsuya...

146
00:12:12,370 --> 00:12:16,870
Yeah. See you again.

147
00:12:16,870 --> 00:12:19,910
I'm looking forward to it.

148
00:12:22,490 --> 00:12:24,010
VISITOR ARC XI

149
00:14:40,910 --> 00:14:43,830
APRIL 5, 2096 - YOTSUBA MAIN RESIDENCE

150
00:14:47,200 --> 00:14:49,080
What are your thoughts, milady?

151
00:14:52,990 --> 00:14:55,450
Let's go with her.

152
00:14:55,450 --> 00:14:57,080
As you wish.

153
00:15:00,790 --> 00:15:03,660
APRIL 6, 2096

154
00:15:18,870 --> 00:15:22,580
You're in an especially good mood today.

155
00:15:22,580 --> 00:15:25,950
It suits you so well, Brother.

156
00:15:25,950 --> 00:15:28,620
The new uniform?

157
00:15:28,620 --> 00:15:32,700
It's as if the uniform
was designed for you, Brother.

158
00:15:32,700 --> 00:15:37,200
In fact, I'll bet it was designed for you!

159
00:15:37,200 --> 00:15:39,160
That's an exaggeration.

160
00:15:39,160 --> 00:15:41,410
It's no exaggeration!

161
00:15:41,410 --> 00:15:46,990
The new Magic Engineering Course
exists because of you!

162
00:15:46,990 --> 00:15:49,580
You call it a new design,

163
00:15:49,580 --> 00:15:52,290
but all they did was add an emblem.

164
00:15:52,290 --> 00:15:55,540
That's what's good about it!

165
00:15:55,540 --> 00:15:56,740
Is that so?

166
00:15:56,740 --> 00:15:57,950
Yes!

167
00:16:01,160 --> 00:16:05,950
Today, the new second
and third-year students officially...

168
00:16:21,200 --> 00:16:26,040
That reminds me! The chocolate you
gave me as a souvenir was so delicious!

169
00:16:26,040 --> 00:16:28,240
Really? Glad to hear it.

170
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:32,040
Good morning.

171
00:16:32,040 --> 00:16:33,700
Good morning, Miyuki!

172
00:16:33,700 --> 00:16:35,200
Morning.

173
00:16:37,200 --> 00:16:40,660
Are we still on for tomorrow?

174
00:16:40,660 --> 00:16:46,540
The party? Yes. Just as we planned.
My brother will take part, too.

175
00:16:46,540 --> 00:16:48,540
Really? Thank you.

176
00:16:48,540 --> 00:16:50,370
No, thank you.

177
00:16:50,370 --> 00:16:52,040
I can't wait!

178
00:16:52,490 --> 00:16:55,410
SHINAGAWA STATION

179
00:17:14,330 --> 00:17:17,410
Last stop. Shinagawa.
This is Shinagawa.

180
00:17:17,410 --> 00:17:19,790
Thank you for riding the train.

181
00:17:21,120 --> 00:17:24,790
Tokyo is as crowded as ever, huh, Fumiya?

182
00:17:24,790 --> 00:17:27,540
It sure is, Sister.

183
00:17:27,540 --> 00:17:29,870
Should we wait for the crowd to thin out?

184
00:17:29,870 --> 00:17:32,660
No, let's just get to the hotel.

185
00:17:37,580 --> 00:17:38,830
At any rate...

186
00:17:38,830 --> 00:17:43,330
this came out of nowhere.
All of a sudden, a job in Tokyo...

187
00:17:43,330 --> 00:17:47,910
Does Dad even know the Fourth High
entrance ceremony is the day after tomorrow?

188
00:17:48,830 --> 00:17:53,580
But you were pleased when you heard
about his job in Tokyo, remember?

189
00:17:53,580 --> 00:17:57,040
You were like,
"I may be able to see Tatsuya there."

190
00:17:57,040 --> 00:17:59,540
I-I'm not pleased at all!

191
00:17:59,540 --> 00:18:02,790
Huh? You're not happy
about the prospect of meeting Tatsuya?

192
00:18:02,790 --> 00:18:05,620
No!

193
00:18:05,620 --> 00:18:11,620
I mean, I would love to see Tatsuya,
but that's not my goal especially.

194
00:18:20,330 --> 00:18:21,910
Enter.

195
00:18:23,790 --> 00:18:27,290
Pardon me. I have brought her here.

196
00:18:29,240 --> 00:18:30,660
Go to her.

197
00:18:30,660 --> 00:18:32,700
Yes, sir. At once.

198
00:18:37,660 --> 00:18:40,830
Minami, raise your head.

199
00:18:40,830 --> 00:18:42,990
Yes, ma'am.

200
00:18:46,950 --> 00:18:51,160
I would like to ask you
to do magician work.

201
00:18:52,410 --> 00:18:55,870
May I inquire about the details?

202
00:18:55,870 --> 00:19:00,240
Do you know Tokyo Offshore Tower?

203
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:02,040
Yes, I know of it.

204
00:19:04,410 --> 00:19:10,330
Tokyo Offshore Tower was erected
in Tokyo Bay and has a height of 2,000 meters.

205
00:19:10,330 --> 00:19:14,040
With 360 floors aboveground
and 36 floors underground,

206
00:19:14,040 --> 00:19:17,290
it's Japan's first hyperbuilding.

207
00:19:17,290 --> 00:19:18,410
Tomorrow night,

208
00:19:18,410 --> 00:19:22,620
there will be a party on the top floor
to celebrate the completion of its construction,

209
00:19:22,620 --> 00:19:29,240
but I have obtained information that a radical
magic supremacist group is targeting the event.

210
00:19:29,240 --> 00:19:33,290
They're called the "New Breed Front."
Perhaps you're familiar with them.

211
00:19:33,290 --> 00:19:35,790
The New Breed Front...

212
00:19:35,790 --> 00:19:38,910
No. I apologize for my ignorance.

213
00:19:40,950 --> 00:19:44,620
They're a group of radical magicians who formed
in response to the discriminatory boycotts

214
00:19:44,620 --> 00:19:46,290
against magicians by the humanists.

215
00:19:46,290 --> 00:19:50,620
They are an extremist group claiming that
magicians are the most evolved form of humans

216
00:19:50,620 --> 00:19:54,080
who will control the future.

217
00:19:54,080 --> 00:19:59,540
Apparently, their goal is to free magicians
from being forced to work like slaves

218
00:19:59,540 --> 00:20:01,830
for the old humanity.

219
00:20:03,660 --> 00:20:08,870
That group is trying to attack
the party tomorrow night?

220
00:20:08,870 --> 00:20:14,370
I can't say for sure that the New Breed Front's
target is the party venue.

221
00:20:14,370 --> 00:20:16,870
However, it is certain
that the time of the party

222
00:20:16,870 --> 00:20:22,330
coincides with their plan
to attack Tokyo Offshore Tower.

223
00:20:22,330 --> 00:20:27,410
It seems they've been adding Extras
to their ranks, as well, so be careful.

224
00:20:27,410 --> 00:20:29,660
Extras?

225
00:20:29,660 --> 00:20:33,450
Yes. I take it you don't know
what they are yet.

226
00:20:33,450 --> 00:20:37,870
It refers to families that have
been stripped of their numbers.

227
00:20:37,870 --> 00:20:39,410
Reasons for their removal are various

228
00:20:39,410 --> 00:20:43,830
but include treason and the failure
to demonstrate their abilities.

229
00:20:45,540 --> 00:20:46,950
I understand.

230
00:20:46,950 --> 00:20:51,040
But what would you like me to do?

231
00:20:51,040 --> 00:20:54,330
I will have someone else
watch the outside of the building.

232
00:20:54,330 --> 00:21:00,620
Minami, I want you to accompany Hayama
and stand by at the party.

233
00:21:00,620 --> 00:21:08,040
If the situation demands urgent attention,
follow Hayama's instructions. Understood?

234
00:21:08,040 --> 00:21:09,540
Yes.

235
00:21:11,620 --> 00:21:12,910
Um...

236
00:21:12,910 --> 00:21:17,200
I would like to ask one thing.

237
00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:18,990
What is it?

238
00:21:18,990 --> 00:21:23,160
What should I actually do at the party?

239
00:21:23,160 --> 00:21:26,200
I don't have any experience
being a party hostess,

240
00:21:26,200 --> 00:21:30,740
so if possible, I'd like to receive a lecture
about my duties beforehand.

241
00:21:34,330 --> 00:21:35,450
Ma'am?

242
00:21:35,450 --> 00:21:38,290
I apologize for laughing.

243
00:21:38,290 --> 00:21:42,490
Oh, there's no need
for you to apologize, ma'am.

244
00:21:42,490 --> 00:21:46,830
It seems you have the wrong idea, Minami.

245
00:21:46,830 --> 00:21:51,200
You will be there as Hayama's bodyguard.

246
00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:55,240
I already have your invitation.

247
00:21:55,240 --> 00:21:57,330
Certainly.

248
00:21:57,330 --> 00:22:02,200
I'll have a dress you'll be able to put on yourself
prepared for you at a hotel in the metro area.

249
00:22:02,200 --> 00:22:04,290
And you can do your own makeup, right?

250
00:22:04,290 --> 00:22:06,490
Yes, that will be no problem.

251
00:22:08,450 --> 00:22:10,240
Good.

252
00:22:10,240 --> 00:22:15,040
I'm sorry for springing this job on you
the day before the entrance ceremony.

253
00:22:16,660 --> 00:22:23,290
If it's an order from you, ma'am,
Minami Sakurai shall gladly obey.

254
00:23:48,490 --> 00:23:52,040
VISITOR ARC XII
